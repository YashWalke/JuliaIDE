# [JuliaIDE](https://github.com/YashWalke/JuliaIDE)
 A simple IDE for Julia language written in Python/PyQt

This repository contains the code for JuliaIDE, a simple IDE for the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/)

JuliaIDE is a IDE created using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PyQt5]() and [QScintilla](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)

Most of the code is implemented from a sister project [PythonIDE](https://github.com/shyamkumaryadav/pythonide), a Python IDE developed using the same tools

This repository is just a excuse for me to improve my Python coding skills
